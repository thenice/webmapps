      <h1>Spatial Adapter for Rails</h1>
<p>
This is the Spatial Adapter for Rails 0.1.1. It is a plugin for Rails which
manages the MySql Spatial and PostGIS geometric columns in a transparent
way (that is like the other base data type columns). It also provides a way
to manage these columns in migrations. It replaces both the &quot;PostGIS
Adapter for Rails&quot; and &quot;MySql Spatial Adapter for Rails&quot;
plugins.
</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>
You need to install a version &gt;= 0.1.1 of the GeoRuby gem (<a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/georuby">rubyforge.org/projects/georuby</a>/)
:
</p>
<pre>
        gem install georuby
</pre>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
At the root of your Rails project, type :
</p>
<pre>
       script\plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/georuby/SpatialAdapter/trunk/spatial_adapter
</pre>
<p>
You need to have SVN installed.
</p>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>
Geometric columns in your <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> models now
appear just like any other column of other basic data types. They can also
be dumped in ruby schema mode and loaded in migrations the same way as
columns of basic types.
</p>
<h4>Migrations</h4>
<p>
Here is an example of code for the creation of a table with a geometric
column in PostGIS, along with the addition of a spatial index on the column
:
</p>
<pre>
        ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
          create_table &quot;table_points&quot;, :force =&gt; true do |t|
            t.column &quot;data&quot;, :string
            t.column &quot;geom&quot;, :point, :null=&gt;false, :srid =&gt; 123, :with_z =&gt; true
          end

          add_index &quot;table_points&quot;, &quot;geom&quot;, :spatial=&gt;true
        end
</pre>
<p>
Here is a related statement valid for MySql version &lt;= 5.0.16 :
</p>
<pre>
        ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
          create_table &quot;table_points&quot;, ;options=&gt;&quot;ENGINE=MyISAM&quot;, :force =&gt; true do |t|
            t.column &quot;data&quot;, :string
            t.column &quot;geom&quot;, :point, :null=&gt;false
          end

          add_index &quot;table_points&quot;, &quot;geom&quot;, :spatial=&gt;true
        end
</pre>
<p>
The differences with the PostGIS version are because of the following
reasons :
</p>
<ul>
<li>On all version of MySql, the :srid and :with_z would be ignored, since they
are not supported.

</li>
<li>On MySql versions &lt;= 5.0.16, you have to add <tt>:options =&gt;
&quot;ENGINE=MyISAM&quot;</tt> to the create_table statetement, since only
MyISAM tables can have geometric columns.

</li>
</ul>
<h4>Model</h4>
<p>
Here is the model you would use, in both MySql and PostGIS:
</p>
<pre>
        class TablePoint &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
        end
</pre>
<p>
That was easy! As you see, there is no need to declare a column as
geometric. The plugin will get this information by itself.
</p>
<h4>Access</h4>
<p>
Here is an example of PostGIS row creation and access, using the model and
the table defined above :
</p>
<pre>
        pt = TablePoint.new(:data =&gt; &quot;Hello!&quot;,:geom =&gt; Point.from_x_y_z(-1.6,2.8,-3.4,123))
        pt.save
        pt = TablePoint.find_first
        puts pt.geom.x #access the geom column like any other
</pre>
<p>
For MySQL, it is slightly different since it does not support Z dimension
or SRID :
</p>
<pre>
        pt = TablePoint.new(:data =&gt; &quot;Hello!&quot;,:geom =&gt; Point.from_x_y(-1.6,2.8))
        pt.save
        pt = TablePoint.find_first
        puts pt.geom.x #access the geom column like any other
</pre>
<h4>Fixtures</h4>
<p>
If you use fixtures for your unit tests, at some point, you will want to
input a geometry. You could transform your geometries to a form suitable
for YAML yourself everytime but the spatial adapter provides a method to do
it for you: <tt>to_yaml</tt>. It works for both MySQL and PostGIS (although
the string returned is different for each database). You would use it like
this, if the geometric column is a point:
</p>
<pre>
        fixture:
         id: 1
         data: HELLO
         geom: &lt;%= Point.from_x_y(123.5,321.9).to_yaml %&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Find_by</h4>
<p>
find_by_[column] has been redefined when column is of a geometric type.
Instead of using the Rails default &#8217;=&#8217; operator, for which I
can&#8216;t see a definition for MySql spatial datatypes and which performs
a bounding box equality test in PostGIS, it uses a bounding box
intersection: &amp;&amp; in PostGIS and MBRIntersects in MySQL, which can
both make use of a spatial index if one is present to speed up the queries.
You could use this query, for example, if you need to display data from the
database: You would want only the geometries which are in the screen
rectangle and you could use a bounding box query for that. Since this is a
common case, it is the default. You have 2 ways to use the
find_by_[geom_column]: Either by passing a geometric object directly, or
passing an array with the 2 opposite corners of a bounding box (with 2 or 3
coordinates depending of the dimension of the data).
</p>
<pre>
        Park.find_by_geom(LineString.from_coordinates([[1.4,5.6],[2.7,8.9],[1.6,5.6]]))
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
        Park.find_by_geom([[3,5.6],[19.98,5.9]])
</pre>
<p>
In PostGIS, since you can only use operations with geometries with the same
SRID, you can add a third element representing the SRID of the bounding box
to the array. It is by default set to -1:
</p>
<pre>
        Park.find_by_geom([[3,5.6],[19.98,5.9],123])
</pre>
<h4>Geometric data types</h4>
<p>
Ruby geometric datatypes are currently made available only through the
GeoRuby library (<a
href="http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/ProjectsDoc/georuby-doc/index.html">thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/ProjectsDoc/georuby-doc/index.html</a>):
This is where the <tt>Point.from_x_y</tt> in the example above comes from.
It is a goal of a future release of the Spatial Adapter to support
additional geometric datatype libraries, such as Ruby/GEOS, as long as they
can support reading and writing of EWKB.
</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you use a version of MySQL before 5.0.16, only tables using the MyISAM
engine can support geometric columns. After MySQL 5.0.16, any engine
(incuding INNODB) is supported.

</li>
<li>Since <a href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a>
seems to keep only the string values directly returned from the database,
it translates from these to the correct types everytime an attribute is
read, which is probably ok for simple types, but might be less than
efficient for geometries, since the EWKB string has to be parsed everytime.
Also it means you cannot modify the geometry object returned from an
attribute directly :

<pre>
     place = Place.find_first
     place.the_geom.y=123456.7
</pre>
</li>
<li>Since the translation to a geometry is performed everytime the_geom is
read, the change to y will not be saved! You would have to do something
like this :

<pre>
     place = Place.find_first
     the_geom = place.the_geom
     the_geom.y=123456.7
     place.the_geom = the_geom
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes since last version</h3>
<ul>
<li>The PostGIS adapter and the MySql Spatial adapter have been merged into one
plugin. The correct files to load is determined using the type of
connection defined in the environment.

</li>
<li>Geometric columns can now be dumped just like other base data types. This
means you can use the ruby schema mode, even if you use the plugin.

</li>
<li>Support of M dimensions in migrations. The <tt>:dimension</tt> key in the
column definition has disappeared and has been replaced by <tt>:with_z</tt>
and <tt>:with_m</tt>.

</li>
<li>Addition of unit tests. At the plugin root, Run <tt>rake test:mysql</tt> to
run the mysql tests and <tt>rake test:postgis</tt> for the postgis ones.
You will need to configure your connection in
<tt>test/db/database_mysql.yml</tt> and
<tt>test/db/database_postgis.yml</tt>. If you get errors on your platform,
please report to <a
href="mailto:guilhem.vellut+georuby@gmail.com">guilhem.vellut+georuby@gmail.com</a>.

</li>
<li>Addition of a find_by methods with a special behaviour for geometries

</li>
<li>Addition of a to_yaml method to use inside a YAML fixture

</li>
</ul>
<h3>TODO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support of other geometric datatype libraries in addition to GeoRuby

</li>
<li>Tutorials

</li>
</ul>
